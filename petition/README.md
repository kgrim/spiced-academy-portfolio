[Petition Project:](https://spiced-sesame.herokuapp.com)

Completion time: 2 weeks

    Tech: Handlebars & PSQL

    Functions: log-in/sign-up, profile edit, signature recorder.

    Main Focus:
    as this was the first full-stack project, there was a lot to learn.
    There is a log-in/sign-up function in which the password is hashed and it would save the log-in in a cookie session.
    Once the user sign-up, they would be directed to the edit profile, where couple of personal questions are asked (this is not mandatory and can be edited later on).
    If the user did not log-out it will automatically direct the user to either sign the petition using the canvas feature or to the thank you page.
    From the thank you page, the user is able to edit the profile, delete the signature or to check out who else signed the petition.
    The petitioners page can also be filtered by clicking on the city or access the other users personal URL/website by clicking on the users' name.

    Design:
    my petition was about the food trend of 'Tiny Plates'.
    This is very much reflected on the website.
    Pastel/translucent colours were used as they mirroring the society's perception of cuteness/dreamy and this is also reflected on the text styling, where the font is rather small.
    Most of the text is rotated sideways to represent the impracticality of the subject.
    On each page all of the information is mostly layered and gathered together to focus on the fact that the content is rather small.
