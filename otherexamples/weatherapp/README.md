## Weather App:

**Completion time:** 5 hours  

**Tech:** React  

**Main Focus:** Creating a simple weather app to further my skills with API and React.

**Design:** I chose the round shape to reflect the sun and also it fills the space rather nicely when you have limited information. The text comes with a text-shadow feature so it can be easily read with the animated background.
