Tech: HTML, CSS, Javascript & jQuery

Main Focus:
Wanted to create a fun to do list where one can add an entry by hitting the enter or by clicking on the button. Items can be completed by clicking on the 'tick' button and removed by clicking on the 'minus' button.

Design:
Chores can make us feel a bit down however wanted to lighten things up with a fun print. Banana yellow tones energise the brain yet the sky blue helps with generating endorphins and helps with concentration.
