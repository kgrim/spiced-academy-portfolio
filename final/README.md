[Final Project (Fighting Game):](http://super-spiced-brothers.herokuapp.com/)

Completion time: 1 week

    Tech: Phaser & Sockets.io

    Functions: Multi-player from different devices, instant response.

    Aim of the Game (no pun intended):
    this is an up to 4 player fighting game where the players have kick each other off the screen while keeping their
    lives.
    Each player has 8 lives and they will not respawn once they are up however can enjoy the rest of the gameplay.
    The user must hit the 'A' button for a punch and 'D' button for a kick.
    Every player has a double jump by hitting the 'UP' button twice.
    Sockets are used in order for the other users to receive the information that would be emitted in real time.

    Design:
    the classic will never go out of fashion! So a very pixel design has been implemented throughout the game.
    The main focus on the project is the multi-player and functionality of application.
    I would like to point out that all of the designs and spritesheets have been drawn/created using CAD programs.

    Extra: this game has been a team project that consist of two people.
    We have decided to work together to learn how to work in a team and contributing to github.
    We also wanted to learn another framework and see how far we can push ourselves given the limited time of 1 week.
